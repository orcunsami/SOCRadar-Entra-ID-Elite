"""
Ownership ledger for the Former Employee sync .

Records which emails on the SOCRadar former list Elite created and confirmed,
so the reconcile planner can distinguish OUR records (removal candidates) from
EXTERNAL records added by the UI or another integration (always preserved).

Privacy (PII): the ledger stores sha256(normalized email),
never the raw address. Membership queries hash the caller's emails and compare,
so the raw list never has to be persisted here.

State machine (a subset of the backlog states, enough to gate deletion safely):

    (absent) --add confirmed--> owned --remove confirmed--> tombstone
       ^                                                        |
       +--------------------- re-add confirmed ------------------

`external` is implicit: any email in `current` whose hash is not `owned` is
external and is never a removal candidate.

Two implementations:
  - InMemoryOwnershipStore: for unit tests and plan-only runs without storage.
  - TableOwnershipStore:     Azure Table `FormerOwnership`
                             (PartitionKey = company id, RowKey = sha256(email)).
