"""
Former Employee observability builders (pure logic, no I/O).

Two consumers, two PII postures — decided 2026-07-25 (option a):

  * build_former_audit_rows -> PERSISTENT Log Analytics audit
    (SOCRadar_EntraID_Audit_CL). Emails as sha256 hashes only. Answers "what happened,
    when, how many, which record (by hash)" forever.

  * build_preview_payload   -> EPHEMERAL authenticated GET response.
    The manager's "deaktif user'lari GOSTER": names WHO would be added or
    removed, in the clear, computed on demand and never stored. `preserve`
    (external records, e.g. a customer's own list) is COUNT-ONLY — the
    plan never touches those and their addresses are not ours to display.

Both builders are pure so the shapes are locked by unit tests without Azure.
