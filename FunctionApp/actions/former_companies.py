"""
Multi-company (Topology 2) parsing and composition for the Former Employee
sync (pure logic, no I/O).

Topology 2 (2026-07-25, corporate-group example — company A 1234567/te1234567,
B 2234567/te2234567, C 3234567/te3234567 in ONE deployment): FORMER_COMPANY_MAP is a
JSON app setting with one row per SOCRadar company:

    [{"company_id": "1234567",
      "own_tenants": ["<tenant-guid>", ...],
      "api_key": "...",                    # or api_key_setting: "FORMER_KEY_1234567"
      "actor_email": "person@company.com"},
     ...]

Group tenants are NEVER entered per row — they are DERIVED: a company's group
is the union of every OTHER row's own tenants (full mesh), plus the legacy
global GROUP_TENANT_IDS (tenants whose users should be suppressed everywhere
but that have no SOCRadar company of their own), minus the company's own.

Topology 1 stays the degenerate case: with no FORMER_COMPANY_MAP the caller
builds a single row from the legacy scalar settings; a single-row map derives
an empty mesh (V2-only unless GROUP_TENANT_IDS is set) — the mode switch is
the configuration itself, not a flag.

Every mutation credential is per-company (each company's former list demands
its OWN api_key and its OWN platform actor_email): a row missing either in
real mode is not an error — a missing actor forces plan-only (list/preview
still work); a missing api_key additionally surfaces that company as a
preview error until the key arrives (real mode needs it even to read).
